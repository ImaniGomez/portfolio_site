      description: 'When working on film sets, script supervisors must keep track of many compenents including the camera settings, actor continuity, sound, and room left on the memory cards. However, when working with celluloide, it is extremely important for script supervisors to keep track of how much film is left in the canister. If this number is inaccurate, it can ruin takes, scheduling and post production workflows. Currently, on sets, script supervisors use three different apps and manually do calculations in order to determine how much film is left in the camera. To make this process easier and more accurate, I will be creating Scripty, A film calculation application that takes in camera settings, film type, film speed, take number, take length, and continuity notes. It outputs the amount of film left and the amount of film already shot.',
